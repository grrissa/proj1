are the binary numbers that are outputted supposed to be sepated somehow?

would the array list for decompress be of type string where the binary is converted 
to ints and that would be the index of the array with the letters as theat that value?
or would they type be an array list of tuples where the binary value is the first number(key) 
and the letters are the 2nd tuple value (value)?

rehash...?

are the values in compress(keys in decompress) supposed to be in binary or ints?
